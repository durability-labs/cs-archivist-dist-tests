# Archivist Continuous Test-net Report
Date: 05-10-2023

Report for: 09-2023


## Test-net Status
- Start of month: Offline - stopped
- End of month: Offline - stopped

(Stopped: The number of tests that can successfully run on the test-net is not high enough to justify the cost of leaving it running.)

## Deployment Configuration
Continuous Test-net is deployed to the kubernetes cluster with the following configuration:

5x Archivist Nodes:
- Log-level: Trace
- Storage quota: 2048 MB
- Storage sell: 1024 MB
- Min price: 1024
- Max collateral: 1024
- Max duration: 3600000 seconds
- Block-TTL*: 180 seconds
- Block-MI*: 120 seconds
- Block-MN*: 10000 blocks

3 of these 5 nodes have:
- Validator: true

Kubernetes namespace: 'archivist-continuous-tests'
* Some tests have been performed with alternative (disabled) maintenance parameters:
- Block-TTL: 99999999 seconds
- Block-MI: 99999999 seconds
- Block-MN: 100 blocks

## Resulting changes
As a result of the testing efforts in 09-2023, these changes were made:
1. Cloud logging infrastructure was upgraded to reliably and verifiably retrieve Archivist container logs.
1. Test runners and tools were upgraded to support automated deploy and run from CI environment.
1. Test runners and tools were upgraded to support to automatic building and use of custom locally-built docker images of Archivist. (This allows to use of local modifications for quick debugging without the need to go through commit/review/CI workflow.)

## Action Points
- We'll be using the upgrades to debug the Two-client test.
